# Solo: The OpenGL Game Engine
Solo is an OpenGL Based Game Engine, Currently Capable of Nothing, The Engine is Highly customizable and can be fixed based on your needs, This Engine is mainly targeted for people who are participating in Game Jams or Making a Prototype of their game, This is more of a Ready-To-Go Game Engine.

## Current Development Progress
I just started developing this Game Engine, It would take a minimum of two months to add most of the 2D Game Engine features, It's kind of hard to predict right now, but the structure would be ready within three days and then would allow all the beautiful people of the Coding Community to participate in the development and make this dream Engine a Reality!

## How to setup the Engine?
On Mac, It's Literally just cloning the repo and setting up the linker, on Window: I Don't Know, Because I am on Mac and it's been ages since I used a Windows Computer!

## How did you Got an IDEA to make an Open Source Engine?
During the Development of my First Jam Game, I quitted because the Idea was way to big and I make my own engines, so I never got till the point to develop the Game and instead started on to make my own Open-Source Engine so that it would make my life and your life a bit easier, It would be quick to make a prototype, and just so quick to make Jam games!
